CUU='A'  #Cursor Up	Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction. If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.
CUD='B'  #Cursor Down
CUF='C'  #Cursor Forward
CUB='D'  #Cursor Back
CNL='E'  #Cursor Next Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines down. (not ANSI.SYS)
CPL='F'  #Cursor Previous Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up. (not ANSI.SYS)
CHA='G'  #Cursor Horizontal Absolute	Moves the cursor to column n (default 1). (not ANSI.SYS)
CUP='H'  #Cursor Position	Moves the cursor to row n, column m. The values are 1-based, and default to 1 (top left corner) if omitted. A sequence such as CSI ;5H is a synonym for CSI 1;5H as well as CSI 17;H is the same as CSI 17H and CSI 17;1H
ED='J'   #Erase in Display	Clears part of the screen. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to end of screen. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the screen. If n is 2, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS). If n is 3, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for xterm and is supported by other terminal applications).
EL='K'   #Erase in Line	Erases part of the line. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is 2, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change.
SU='S'   #Scroll Up	Scroll whole page up by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the bottom. (not ANSI.SYS)
SD='T'   #Scroll Down	Scroll whole page down by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the top. (not ANSI.SYS)
HVP='f'	 #Horizontal Vertical Position	Same as CUP, but counts as a format effector function (like CR or LF) rather than an editor function (like CUD or CNL). This can lead to different handling in certain terminal modes.[14]:â€ŠAnnex A
SGR='m'	 #Select Graphic Rendition	Sets colors and style of the characters following this code
DSR='6n' #Device Status Report	Reports the cursor position (CPR) by transmitting ESC[n;mR, where n is the row and m is the column.
